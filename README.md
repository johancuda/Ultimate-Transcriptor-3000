# Ultimate Transcriptor 3000
 A small tool to help with transcribing interviews.

## Description

This simple web app helps you with correcting text transcriptions created using a transcription software. Try it here : [Ultimate Transcriptor 3000](https://johancuda.github.io/Ultimate-Transcriptor-3000/).

The goal of this web app is to provide you with a simple interface to listen to an audio recording whilst correcting the transcription, with a few basic functionalities like a play/pause button and the possibility to rewind 5 seconds of your audio. The text input supports `.txt` and `.vtt` files. Text and audio files are stored using [IndexedDB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) so that you don't lose your progress if you refresh the page. You can save your transcription in `.txt` and `.vtt`.

## Shortcuts

- <kbd>Tab</kbd> : Play/pause
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> : Rewind 5 seconds

## TODO

- Clear DB upon closing the tab
- Highlighting and rich text formatting
